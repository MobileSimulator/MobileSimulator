Report bugs

Issues can be reported in the issue section on GitHub. Before reporting a new bug, make sure to do some checkups.

1. Check if the bug has been reported. Look it up in that same issue section on GitHub.

2. Read the docs. Make sure that the issue is a bug, not a misunderstanding on how is Mobile Sim supposed to work. Read the pages related to the issue in the :ref:`documentation` and take a look at the FAQ page.
