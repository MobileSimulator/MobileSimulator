The **MR-Sim** (Mobile Robot Simulator) is a framework based on [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/) and [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html). It is built on popular mobile robots that include Four-differential, Ackermann, and Dynamic control systems. The simulator provides models of various robots such as [Husky UGV](https://clearpathrobotics.com/husky-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/), [QCar](https://www.quanser.com/products/qcar/), [Franka Research 3](https://franka.de/research), and a integration of [Husky + FR3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwqMOhF1UuI). At this moment, the simulator is under development, and more features will be provided in the future, including slam, real-time ROS connection, and more. In any case, here are a few suggestions for newcomers.


## Project Founder
The **Mobile Robot Simulator** is an open-source framework, started by Ji Sue Lee and Dong Beom Kim in April/2024. It is a tool that was create with the original purpose of devloping our intuition. This project is planned to take a total of 1 year, with completion expected by 2025.
